# Food Planner API

Food Planner API is a lightweight REST backend built with **Flask** and **Flask-SQLAlchemy**.  
It serves as the foundation for a future meal-planning system that will manage ingredients, recipes, and meal schedules.

The current version contains the basic application architecture and example endpoints for the **Ingredients** resource.
